# jQuery-Slider

This is a practice exercise from the Odin Project curriculum.

The 3-part walkthrough I followed is by Joseph Smith and starts here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtYP_eSVKfs&t=302s

I made several slight modifications to the approach he describes, including
switching out a couple jQuery methods in order to clean up the HTML a bit. Changes
are marked in comments.
